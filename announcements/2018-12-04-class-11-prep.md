# Class 11 Preparations

Hello Students,

As we explore how computer-based systems become more interconnected and scalable, thanks for a great discussion today about computer networks, machine readable data, and APIs.

To prepare for next class, please complete the ["Processing CSV Strings"](/exercises/processing-csv-strings.md) exercise to the best of your ability, and also attempt the ["Processing Internet Data"](/exercises/processing-internet-data.md) exercise. Next class will be more hands-on, as I will ask for volunteers to help us work through solutions for both exercises.

Also, please be advised that based on pace of today's class discussion, I made some minor schedule revisions, including extending the due date of the fourth and final project, the ["Robo Advisor"](/projects/robo-advisor.md), to 12/13.

I look forward to seeing you on Thursday!

 \- Professor Rossetti

PS - As a reminder, there is NO final exam for this class.
