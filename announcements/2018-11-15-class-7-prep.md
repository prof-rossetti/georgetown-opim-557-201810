# Class 7 Preparations

Hello Students,

Please be advised that I just made some [schedule](https://georgetown.instructure.com/calendar#view_name=month&view_start=2018-11-15) revisions, including pushing back the due date for the [Savings Calculator](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/georgetown-opim-557-201810/blob/master/projects/savings-calc.md) project until after Thanksgiving. Based on our progress at the end of today's class I determined we need to spend more time on [loops](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/georgetown-opim-557-201810/blob/master/notes/visual-basic/loops.md), and I want to make sure you have enough time to develop projects you can be proud of, at a pace that is as comfortable as possible. So, although you are encouraged to start working on your projects, there is no pressure to finish them this weekend.

Before next class, if you have time, try to work your way through as much of the [Processing CSV Strings](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/georgetown-opim-557-201810/blob/master/exercises/processing-csv-strings.md) and/or [Simulated Returns](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/georgetown-opim-557-201810/blob/master/exercises/simulated-returns.md) exercises as possible. We will pick up with solutions to these exercises at the beginning of class.

Have a great weekend, and see you next week!

 \- Professor Rossetti
