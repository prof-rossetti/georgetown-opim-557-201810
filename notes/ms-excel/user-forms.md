# User Forms

## Insertion

To insert a new User Form, right-click anywhere in the VBE Project pane, and click "Insert" > "UserForm".

After creating a new User Form, you should see it in the Project Pane.

## Properties

If you want to rename the User Form, or change any of its properties, you can right-click on the User Form itself (the dotted background, not any other elements on it), then click "Properties" to reveal its properties.

## Designing

Double-click on the User Form in the Project pane to enter into design mode.

In design mode, you can add resize the User Form, add controls, modify properties, etc.

Once you have added controls, for example a command button, you can reveal the underlying code by double-clicking on the given control in design mode.

## Showing and Hiding

Once you have created a User Form, note its name, then call `Show` on it from somewhere else (perhaps from a workbook open event or a click event for a button on some worksheet) to programmatically launch it.

To show:

```vb
UserForm1.Show
```

To hide:

```vb
UserForm1.Hide
```

## Multi-page Objects

Insert a MultiPage object onto a User Form to create multiple layouts accessible at different times in the same space.

### Events

The MultiPage object has its own events:

name | description
--- | ---
`Enter` | Triggers when the multi-page object is first launched.
`Change` | Triggers when the page changes.

### Navigation

When navigating across different pages, set the `MultiPage.Value` as the (zero-based) index number of the page you'd like to navigate to. For example:

```vb
UserForm1.MultiPage.Value = 0 ' DISPLAY PAGE 1

UserForm1.MultiPage.Value = 1 ' DISPLAY PAGE 2

UserForm1.MultiPage.Value = 2 ' DISPLAY PAGE 3
```

### Controls

User Form controls are similar to ActiveX Controls, but there are noticeable differences.

For example, to populate the list of selectable options in a Combo Box on your User Form: instead of using the `ListFillRange` property like you would do for an ActiveX Control (which doesn't appear to be available for the User Form version of the control), you can programmatically set the `AddItem` property when the form is initialized (i.e. before it becomes visible to the user), like this:

```vb
' h/t: https://analysistabs.com/vba-code/excel-userform/combobox/
Private Sub UserForm_Initialize()
    ComboBox1.AddItem "My Option"
    ComboBox1.AddItem "Other Option"
End Sub
```

`Initialize` is an event that gets triggered when the User Form is first loaded/launched, so when we populate the Combo Box's selectable items during this event, they will appear for the user when the user sees the form.

You will likely notice other differences for other controls as well.
