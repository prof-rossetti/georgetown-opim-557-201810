# Metrics & Data-driven Decisions

**Metrics** are key performance indicators which can be measured (often over time) to assess progress toward some objective or goal.

For example, if a person's goal is to improve their physical health, they might choose metrics such as "Weight" and "Body Fat Percentage" as a proxy for overall physical health. And they might periodically measure and track these values over time. They might conclude that if their "Body Fat Percentage" metric drops below a specified target value, then they will have met their goal.
